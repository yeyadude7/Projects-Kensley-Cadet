matrixDet.java: Matrix Determinant Calculator 

C Caches Kensley Cadet: 
I have created separate code for each cache Each program requires the traces.txt file
All performance comparisons are implemented individually within each code via printf statements:

    Fully Associative with LRU: HITS = 6504, ACCESSES = 9999, HIT RATE = 0.650465
    Fully Associative with Random: HITS = 6265, ACCESSES = 9999, HIT RATE = 0.626563
    Direct Mapping: HITS = 806, ACCESSES = 9999, HIT RATE = 0.080608
    4-Way Cache with LRU: HITS = 1353, ACCESSES = 9999, HIT RATE = 0.135314
    4-Way Cache with Random: HITS = 1540, ACCESSES = 9999, HIT RATE = 0.154015
    2-Way Cache with LRU: HITS = 1137, ACCESSES = 9999, HIT RATE = 0.113711
    2-Way Cache with Random: HITS = 1105, ACCESSES = 9999, HIT RATE = 0.110511
